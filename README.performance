I have run tests of this code on two machines to determine the performance
it is capable of.  The first is my development laptop, a 1.2GHz Celeron
(with cpufreq pushing it down to 800MHz), running on the JFS filesystem.
The other is our mail server, a 2.66Ghz P4 running on the XFS filesystem
running on a two-drive RAID-1 storage system.  This RAID array was two
7200RPM Hitachi 80GB SATA drives using a 3ware controller.

Both machines had the "safe writing" disabled for maillog in syslog.conf
(by prefixing the maillog path name with a "-").

My test data was 50,756 greylist requests culled from the log files
accumulated over a few days of actual traffic.  The test used greylisting
first, and then SPF if greylisting did not block.  I believe that in most
cases greylisting would be blocking.

On the development laptop, it took 5 minutes 1 second, for an overall rate
of 168 RCPTs per second.

On the mail server, it took 2 minute 12 seconds, for an overall rate of 384
RCPTs per second.

These both seemed to be using 100% CPU time.  Obviously, with other mail
processing going on there will be less CPU and disc bandwidth available for
tumgreyspf.  However, greylisting is blocking well over 80% of incoming
messages right now on our server.  Thus, there are around 5x fewer messages
being processed, leading to much more overall available resources.
