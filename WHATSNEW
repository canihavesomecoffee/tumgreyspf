Fixing tumgreyspf-install if recipient_restrictions is the last line of
      main.cf.  Patch from wforms on github.

Version 1.38 -- Tue Jun 03, 2014

Changing configtest to exit with 0 on success.  Reported by Florian Heigl

================================
Version 1.37 -- Mon Aug 12, 2013

Handling pyspf 2.0.8 and higher which remove some functions we rely on.
      Reported by Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven.
Simplifying the loopback detection code, using simple address checking
      or CIDR testing if the ipaddress module is available.  The new
      code checks for common loopback addresses, and if it isn't one of
      those it will try doing a more extensive check if the "ipaddress"
      module is avaiable.  If not, it assumes this is good enough.
      The "ipaddress" module is included in Python 3.3, or for Python 2:
      https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2-ipaddress/1.0
      This is entirely optional.
Adding a unittest if run with "--test", currently just testing loopback
      detection code.

================================
Version 1.36 -- Thu Nov 24, 2011

New configuration setting "spfAcceptOnPermError" will accept e-mail from
      hosts that have invalid SPF records.  This is probably the right

Added a "COMMON PROBLEMS" section to README, with suggested text from
      George Sexton.
Changed README to put tumgreyspf in recipient restrictions, not sender.
      Reported by George Sexton.

   greylist".  Patch submitted by Paul Tiemann.

================================
Version 1.12 -- Thu Feb 02, 2006

A patch from Scott Scriven which implements a new setting,
      "ignoreLastByte".  When set, the last byte of the IP address is
      ignored so that mail servers in a pool of the same /24 network block
      can more easily get mail through.  This defaults to off.

Adding documentation about file-system problems when using ext2/ext3
      and how to avoid them.

Version 1.06 -- Thu Apr 15, 2005

Changing the install script to indent second line of master.cf file
      (reported by Stephen Warren)
Got a report from Stephen Warren that "tumgreyspf-install" does not work in
      a number of ways with his pre-existing postfix configuration files.

      of automatic.

No configuration of the main program is necessary now.
Greylist data file ctime/atime is now updated when a new message comes in.
